# AdventureWorks-Report
This is a sales report for AdventureWorks, a biking company.
This project is part of my professional specialization to Microsoft Power BI Desktop issued by Maven Analytics. All of the work done is fully executed by myself, implementing all of the skills gained through this course and my overall experience so far. 
The dataset file format is .csv and consists of two fact tables and six dimension tables from which I have created from scratch a relational model with 1-to-many ralationships (primary keys to foreign keys). 
My analysis scope is to analyze the firms sales in bikes, bike's accessories and clothing categories and find insights for the best customers in order to take data driven decisions.
Related to my techniques, I have cleaned, validated and manipulated my data inside Query Editor at back-end level and I have also created some calculated columns at front-end level at table view.
Last but not least I have created advanced explicit DAX measures for better performance and created interactive visualizations combined with some advanced techniques like a drillthrough connection between the matrix of top 10 products of the Exec Dashboard and the Product Details Dashboard.
I hope you find this one interesting!
